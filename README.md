# Gem of Proportio

Gem of Proportio is our entry in the GMTK2024 game jam, which had the "Built to scale" theme and a 96 hour time limit. This repository contains all of the game's assets.

## Description

Our game is a short 3D first person puzzle game, in which the player takes on the role of Magnus, a wizard which was granted the ability to control his size, as well as the size of the objects in the world. The player's task is to complete a few tasks, in order to escape the prison which contains him and to reach the Gem of Proportio. He does this across a total of 3 levels set in different areas.

## Playing

If you wish to play the game, there is both a WebGL, as well as a Windows version available on [itch](https://alexturculet.itch.io/gem-of-proportio).

## Installation

If you wish to download the project and mess with it, you can easily fork the repository, but you will require a Unity install. The project was created on Unity version 2022.3.22f1 and we do not guarantee it will work on other versions.
